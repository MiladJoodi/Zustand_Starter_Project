# Zustand Starter Project

This is a simple starter project built with **Next.js 14.2** and **Zustand**. It provides a foundational setup to help you quickly get started with state management in Next.js applications. 

## Features

- **State Management**: Uses [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) for lightweight and scalable state management.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Includes the capability to persist state to `localStorage`.
- **Multiple Branches**:
  - `main`: Basic Zustand implementation.
  - `persist`: Zustand with localStorage persistence.

## Branches

### Main Branch
The main branch contains a basic implementation of Zustand to manage state efficiently in a Next.js environment.

### Persist Branch
The `persist` branch adds functionality to persist state in `localStorage`, ensuring that your state remains intact even after a page refresh.

To switch to the `persist` branch, run the following command:

```bash
git checkout persist
```
